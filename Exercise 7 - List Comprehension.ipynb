    "The idea of a list comprehension is to make code more compact to accomplish tasks involving lists. Take for example this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  years_of_birth = [1990, 1991, 1990, 1990, 1992, 1991]\n",
    "  ages = []\n",
    "  for year in years_of_birth: \n",
    "    ages.append(2014 - year)\n",
    "And at the end, the variable ages has the list [24, 23, 24, 24, 22, 23]. What this code did was translate the years of birth into ages, and it took us a for loop and an append statement to a new list to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to this piece of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  years_of_birth = [1990, 1991, 1990, 1990, 1992, 1991]\n",
    "  ages = [2014 - year for year in years_of_birth]\n",
    "The second line here - the line with ages is a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "It accomplishes the same thing as the first code sample - at the end, the ages variable has a list containing [24, 23, 24, 24, 22, 23], the ages corresponding to all the birthdates."
